# Bears, River, Fish

We are going to build a small ecosystem! We want to create an ecosystem made up of 3 parts: bears, river and fish. You will need a class for each of these. From this you can make instances and build your ecosystem.

## How Our Ecosystem Works

- A fish should have a name

- A river should have a name e.g. "Amazon"
- A river should hold many fish

- A bear should have a name e.g. "Yogi" and a type e.g. "Grizzly"
- A bear should have an empty belly ( maybe an array... )

- A bear should be able to take a fish from the river
- A river should lose a fish when a bear takes a fish

## Extensions

- A bear could be able to roar
- A bear could report how many fish are in its belly

## Super-duper extension

- A river could trigger spawning (fish having babies)
